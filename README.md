# My personal website

### it can be found [here](https://kovac04.github.io/site/)

##### This was an assignement for my CMPT276 class at SFU. I always wanted to make a website but I kept putting it off. Shout out to my professor for finally forcing me to do it.
##### Keep in mind this website will keep changing and you are most likely looking at a more refined version of it

#### For this website I just used html and css. I don't plan on making it any more fancy or modern. I like this look.

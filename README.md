# My personal website
## it can be found [here](https://kovac04.github.io/site/)
### This was an assignement for my CMPT276 class at SFU. I always wanted to make a website but I kept putting it off. Shout out to my professor for finally forcing me to do it.
#### Keep in mind this website will keep changing and you are most likely looking at a more refined version of it

#### For this website I just used html and css. I don't plan on making it any more fancy or modern. I like this look.


#### I chose MIT license because I don't mind people using my work at all and it  is one of the simplest open source licenses. It allows users to do almost anything with my project: using, copying, modifying, merging, publishing, distributing, sublicensing, or selling copies of the my website, as long as they provide attribution back to me.
